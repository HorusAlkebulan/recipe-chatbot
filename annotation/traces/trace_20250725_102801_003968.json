Here's a classic homemade apple pie recipe that serves 6 people:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n_For the crust:_\n- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar\n- 1 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes\n- 4-6 tablespoons ice water\n\n_For the filling:_\n- 5-6 medium apples (about 2 pounds), preferably Granny Smith or Honeycrisp\n- 3/4 cup granulated sugar\n- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n- 1 teaspoon lemon juice\n- A pinch of salt\n\n_For assembly and finishing:_\n- 1 egg, beaten (for brushing)\n- Sugar for sprinkling (optional)\n\n---\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the crust:**\n   - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar.\n   - Add the cold, cubed butter to the bowl. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with pea-sized pieces.\n   - Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing gently until the dough begins to come together. Do not overmix.\n   - Divide the dough into two equal parts, shape each into a flat disc, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n\n2. **Prepare the filling:**\n   - Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples.\n   - Place the apple slices in a large bowl. Add lemon juice to prevent browning.\n   - In a small bowl, combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt.\n   - Sprinkle this mixture over the apples and toss gently to coat evenly.\n\n3. **Assemble the pie:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C).\n   - Remove one disc of dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 12-inch circle.\n   - Transfer the rolled dough to a 9-inch pie dish, gently pressing it into the sides.\n   - Pour the apple filling into the crust, spreading it evenly.\n   - Remove the second disc of dough from the fridge, roll it into a 12-inch circle.\n   - Place over the filling. Trim excess dough, then crimp the edges to seal.\n   - Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.\n\n4. **Bake the pie:**\n   - Brush the top crust with beaten egg for a shiny finish.\n   - Sprinkle with a little sugar if desired.\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.\n   - If the edges brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.\n\n5. **Cool and serve:**\n   - Allow the pie to cool for at least 2 hours before slicing to let the filling set.\n   - Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.\n\nEnjoy your homemade apple pie \u2014 a perfect dessert with a flaky crust and tender, spiced apples!"}]}}
